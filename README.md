# Data science projects

Meteorologia: This is a project which objective was to analyse Basilea's temperature and precipitation data from 2008 to 2022
to get the following answers: errasing non important values, visualizing the data (temperature and precipitation), 
calculate the mean temperature and ploting 95% error bars in order to identify abnormal values.

TR (Research project): In this folder you will find code that I made in order to understand the basics of the most common algorithms used for malware prediction, such as trees, naive bayes and random forest.
